# Distributed-Resource-Allocation-5G

Distributed Resource Allocation in 5G Networks. 

The Lat-Long data is used to compute a Graph of connected nodes (FAPs and Base Stations). Based on a predefined threshold, interference management computation is performed on the WAN graph. 
MISTest.py: Computes the Maximum Independent Set in the Graph
Allocate.py: Allocates resources to the FAPs based on intereference management.
